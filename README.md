# 👋 Hi, I’m @j-maynard...

I'm a developer at GDS based in London working on amoungst other things Digital Identy, stringing together AWS services and writing code in Java, Python and Ruby (oh and a shocking amount of shell script).  I'm pretty passionate about open source software and developing in the open.

I'm a gamer in my free time and I do occational projects using Raspberry Pi's when the mood takes me.  Laptops of choice are a M1 MacBook Pro and a Razer Blade Advanced (4K) running Linux (Kubuntu).  You'll find in my laptop bag a pair of Raspberry Pi Zero 2s, the odd HAT to go with them and a USB-C to Micro-usb cable to hook them up on the go.

## I’m interested in ...

* Coding
* Gaming
* Raspberry Pi Dev
* Open Source
* Being a better Developer

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

* AWS Serverless - Big part of my every day work at the moment.
* Swift - Always wanted to be a Mac/iOS/iPad Developer but now starting to turn my hand to it when I find time. 

# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Nothing particuarly at the moment.  Though I am open to suggestions.
